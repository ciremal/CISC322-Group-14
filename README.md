# This year's project is Bitcoin Core
i.e., the reference open-source client of the Bitcoin protocol for electronic payments, with its source code available here. While Bitcoin by now is a household name, a system like Bitcoin Core is rather complex and involves a wide range of advanced concepts. 

As such, we suggest the following sources of information as starting points (and encourage  everyone to find other information sources to put on your group web sites):

* https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf
This journal paper introduced the Bitcoin protocol back in 2008.
* https://developer.bitcoin.org/devguide/index.html#
This web page provides a great overview of the main concepts in Bitcoin Core and the underlying blockchain conceptsSeveral textual documents in.
* https://cypherpunks-core.github.io/bitcoinbook/
Even more detail can be find in this open-source book.

As part of this course project, each group will have to analyze, recover and extend the architecture of Bitcoin Core to submit the deliverables specified here. Details for each deliverable, and corresponding deadlines are provided below:
* A0. Group Web Site
* A1. Conceptual Architecture
* A2. Concrete Architecture
* A3. Architectural Enhancement
